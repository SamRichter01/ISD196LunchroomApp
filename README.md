# ISD196LunchroomApp

9/13/19

Hi, y'all.
I don't know if the app is still being worked on, but if you'd like to contact me the best place to do that is by emailing:
rich9794@stthomas.edu

Reason's you might want to contact me:
1. Berate me for poor code
2. Ask questions about poor code
3. Let me know how development is going

Thanks, Sam
